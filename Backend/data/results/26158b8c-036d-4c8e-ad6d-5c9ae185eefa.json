    "conclusion": "The correspondence established in this article shows\nthat deterministic agents in artificial intelligence and\none-input process functions in the foundations of physics\nare mathematically equivalent. Our main result proves\na bijection between equivalence classes of finite-memory\nPOMDP agents and one-input process functions: com-\nbining an agent\u2019s policy and memory update yields a 1-\ninput process function, whilst every such process function\ndecomposes uniquely back into a policy and update.
